**NOTE :** I've not integrated contact_me.php which was there in original theme, as anyway it was not working for me on Jekyll Server. It will need separate PHP Server to work, unless there's a way to make Jekyll & PHP run on same server which I'm not aware as of now.

Instead of that, you can use third party contact form services such as [Simple Form](http://getsimpleform.com) which is pretty easy configure. I've used it myself on my private blog [here](http://incognitech.in).
