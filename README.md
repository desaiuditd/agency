## Agency Jekyll-Bootstrap Theme Demo Site

Developed using Jekyll, Jekyll-BootStrap.

Theme adapted from [Agency Bootstrap Template](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/) and [its Jekyll version](https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme/).

I've make it compatible with the Jekyll-Bootstrap framework adding support for Blog, Categories, Tags and Post, Page layouts which were not present in the earlier version.
